# Server change plan and MOD
![server-icon](https://github.com/Hugo1314520/My-server./assets/122942974/8d6b2dac-63ca-460c-b174-063960b3501f)

üöÄThis is a self-created server that contains a variety of game and experience facilities. I hope it can better improve more experiences and cause the majority of players to become bored and tired of this server.
I have roughly planned all the MODs on the Minecraft server and the contents are as follows:
1. Pok√©mon MOD and more Pok√©mon content
2. The mythical beast counts down in seconds! Divine beast double yolk egg!
3. Transform into a Pok√©mon elf!
4. Draw the sword and more contents about drawing the sword
5. Rendering and game frame freezes
Gameplay such as equivalent exchange and technological mystery may be added in the future!
However, for general identification, we will not accept more mods to burden the server and smoothness!

üëçPlanning for newbies and experience content:
1. The rough plan is to treat each player‚Äôs feelings and server experience in a formal way on 2024/8/1/1 or 2025/1/1.
2. The gameplay experience of future mods and server content has been tolerant and compatible with novices. We will continue to control novices and minors, otherwise minors will recharge games, etc...
3. Private transactions of money, content of our server, etc. are prohibited! Wait, otherwise I will be held legally responsible and I will not be held responsible! Just to treat every player and not be deceived, etc..
4. Future gameplay! Avoid the perception of being generally boring and quitting the game, and gain more favorability towards the server!
5. For server mobile game players, our server will also update our server‚Äôs software with extremely fast content to provide mobile game players, etc...
